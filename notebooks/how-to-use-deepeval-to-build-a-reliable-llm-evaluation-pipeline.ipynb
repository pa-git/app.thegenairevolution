        "LLM outputs are inconsistent. You ship a feature, tweak a prompt, and suddenly your chatbot hallucinates policy details or ignores retrieved context. Without automated evaluation, you catch these failures in production, not before merge.\n\nThis guide shows you how to build a reliable LLM evaluation pipeline with DeepEval. You will install DeepEval, write your first test case with all required fields, choose and threshold metrics for your use case, and run dataset evaluations in pytest and CI to catch regressions before they reach users.\n\n## What Is DeepEval and Why Use It for LLM Testing\n\nDeepEval is an open-source Python framework that automates LLM output evaluation using metrics like answer relevancy, faithfulness, and contextual relevancy. Instead of manual spot checks, you define test cases with inputs, expected behavior, and context, then assert that outputs meet quality thresholds. DeepEval runs these assertions in your test suite, CI pipeline, and nightly regression jobs.\n\nTraditional unit tests check deterministic logic. LLM outputs are probabilistic and context-dependent. DeepEval bridges this gap by scoring outputs against semantic criteria (does the answer address the question? does it stay grounded in retrieved documents?) and failing tests when scores drop below your threshold. This lets you treat LLM quality like any other software requirement: measurable, repeatable, and enforceable in CI.\n\nDeepEval fits into your development lifecycle at three points. Locally, you run single test cases while iterating on prompts or retrieval logic. In pull request CI, you run a fast subset of critical cases to block regressions. In nightly or pre-release jobs, you run the full dataset to catch edge cases and drift across model versions or data updates.\n\nThe core value is speed and confidence. You catch prompt regressions in seconds, not after user reports. You compare model versions with quantitative scores, not gut feel. You scale evaluation from 10 test cases to 1,000 without manual review.\n\n## Install DeepEval and Run Your First Test Case\n\nDeepEval requires Python 3.9 or later. You will also need API keys for the judge model provider (OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, or another supported backend). Set your API key as an environment variable before running tests (e.g., `export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key`). DeepEval uses these judge models to score outputs against metrics.\n\nInstall DeepEval from PyPI in a clean virtual environment:"

        "When you run this code, DeepEval sends the input and output to a judge model, which returns a relevancy score between 0 and 1. If the score meets or exceeds the threshold (0.7), the test passes. If it falls below, `assert_test` raises an `AssertionError` with the score and failure reason. You will see output like `score=0.85, threshold=0.7, status=passed` in your terminal. This pass/fail signal is what you will use in CI to block bad changes.\n\nThe `expected_output` field is optional. Use it when you need exact format constraints (e.g., JSON schema, required entities, policy-mandated phrases) or when you want to compare semantic similarity to a reference answer. For most cases, metrics alone are sufficient. Include `context` when evaluating RAG pipelines, as shown in the next section.\n\n## Choose the Right Metrics for Your Use Case\n\nDeepEval provides metrics for different LLM patterns. Answer relevancy measures whether the output addresses the input question. Faithfulness checks if the output is grounded in provided context (critical for RAG). Contextual relevancy evaluates whether retrieved context chunks are useful for answering the question. Other metrics cover toxicity, bias, hallucination, and tool use.\n\nIf your app is a Q and A assistant, relevance and correctness matter. If it is RAG based, groundedness and context alignment matter. If it is a workflow agent, tool use and instruction adherence matter. Use the smallest set of metrics that catches real failures. For a deeper dive into building reliable RAG pipelines and implementing vector store retrieval, see our [Ultimate Guide to Vector Store Retrieval for RAG Systems](/article/rag-101-build-an-index-run-semantic-search-and-use-langchain-to-automate-it).\n\nStart with one or two metrics per intent type. For a RAG assistant, combine answer relevancy and faithfulness:"

        "Thresholds control when tests fail. Set them based on baseline performance, not arbitrary targets. Run your pipeline on a representative sample (20 to 50 cases), collect scores, and set thresholds at the 20th percentile for each metric. This ensures you catch real degradation without failing on normal variance. For high-stakes outputs (policy answers, financial data), tighten thresholds to the 50th percentile or higher.\n\nMetrics that use judge models (like faithfulness and relevancy) are not perfectly deterministic. Control variance by setting temperature to 0 in your LLM pipeline where possible, using fixed random seeds, and pinning the judge model version in your DeepEval configuration. Log the judge model version and evaluator prompt with each test run so you can trace changes in scores back to evaluation drift, not just model drift.\n\nFor RAG pipelines, ensure the `context` field in your test case matches what your model actually saw during generation. If your retrieval step returns three chunks, pass those exact chunks to `LLMTestCase`. Do not pass different or additional context only to the evaluator, or you will get false passes (model hallucinates but evaluator sees grounding docs) or false failures (model uses correct context but evaluator sees incomplete context). Capture retrieved chunks during your pipeline run and attach them to the test case before evaluation.\n\nHere is a practical RAG example that evaluates both faithfulness and contextual relevancy:"

        "When a test fails, DeepEval returns the score, threshold, and a reason string explaining why the output did not meet the criteria. Inspect this output in your terminal or CI logs to iterate quickly. For example, a faithfulness failure might show \"claim not supported by context\" with the specific unsupported sentence highlighted.\n\nMany real applications require structured output (JSON schemas, tool call arguments, specific templates). DeepEval semantic metrics do not validate format. Add complementary checks: parse JSON, validate against your schema, and assert required fields before running semantic metrics. This catches format breaks immediately and keeps semantic evaluation focused on content quality.\n\n## Build a Dataset-Driven Evaluation Workflow\n\nSingle tests help you get started, but they do not protect you from regressions. You need a dataset that represents your product. Include happy paths, edge cases, policy and safety cases, and known failure modes. Then run the full set on every meaningful change, such as prompt edits, model version bumps, retrieval changes, and tool schema changes.

Separate \"fast unit eval\" from \"full regression eval\" using pytest markers or separate test files.\n\nControl costs and latency by sampling intelligently. For large datasets, run all cases nightly but only high-priority cases in PR CI. Mock tool calls and external API responses in CI to avoid flakiness and cost. Use fixed retrieval snapshots (pre-retrieved context stored in your test dataset) instead of live retrieval in CI to ensure repeatability. Set timeouts and retries for judge model calls to handle transient API failures.\n\nPin your judge model version and evaluator prompts in your DeepEval configuration. Log these versions with each test run so you can trace score changes back to evaluation drift, not just model or prompt changes. Store evaluation artifacts (scores, failure reasons, test case IDs) in CI logs or a dedicated results database for historical comparison and debugging.\n\nWhen you change prompts, model versions, or retrieval logic, run your full evaluation dataset before merging. Compare aggregate scores (mean, median, pass rate per metric) to your baseline. If scores drop significantly, inspect failing cases to determine whether the change introduced a real regression or whether thresholds need adjustment.
