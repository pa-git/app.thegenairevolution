        "Generating test scenarios from acceptance criteria often produces shallow, happy-path-only outputs that ignore edge cases, security risks, and format requirements. This happens because instruction dilution and missing delimiters cause format contamination and incomplete coverage.\n\nThis guide shows you a five-part prompt scaffold to generate schema-compliant Gherkin test suites from acceptance criteria. You'll see a before/after comparison where a naive prompt yields 3 generic scenarios, and a structured prompt yields 12 schema-valid scenarios with boundary and OWASP coverage.\n\n## What Problem Are We Solving?\n\nWhen you prompt a language model to generate test scenarios, you typically get:\n\n- Only happy-path cases with no boundary or negative tests.\n- Outputs that ignore acceptance criteria or blend them into prose.\n- Gherkin syntax errors that break parsers and runners.\n- Missing security or edge-case coverage.\n\nFor example, a naive prompt like \"Generate test scenarios for this user story\" produces 3 generic scenarios focused on success flows. A structured prompt with delimiters, explicit counts, and schema constraints produces 12 parseable scenarios covering happy paths, boundaries, negatives, and OWASP risks.\n\n## What's Actually Happening Under the Hood?\n\nFour mechanisms explain why unstructured prompts fail:\n\n- **Recency and salience bias.** Models prioritize instructions near the generation task. If acceptance criteria appear early and the generation instruction appears late, the model may ignore the criteria.\n- **Instruction dilution.** Mixing requirements, format rules, and constraints in a single block reduces compliance. The model treats everything as suggestions rather than hard rules.\n- **Format contamination.** Without delimiters, the model blends instructions into the output. You get explanatory text instead of clean Gherkin.\n- **Exploration vs. compliance tension.** Models default to creative, varied outputs. Without explicit constraints (counts, tags, schema fields), they skip edge cases and security scenarios.\n\nThe following diagram shows how proper ordering and delimiters prevent contamination:"
