The selection process for infrastructure depends on GPU versus CPU systems and methods for scaling operations.\n\n### GPU/CPU Configurations\n\nThe system requires GPU processing for high-throughput operations and large model applications.\nThe CPU operates best for running small workloads while providing cost-effective deployment options.\n\n### Scaling Decisions\n\nThe system needs auto-scaling functionality to manage different workload levels effectively. The flexible scaling features of AWS and GCP make them suitable for deployment.\n\n## Observability & Maintenance\n\nThe implementation of observability tools helps GenAI applications maintain their operational stability and operational performance.\n\n### Monitoring with LLMOps\n\nReal-time system monitoring and alerting functions are available through Prometheus and Grafana tools."
