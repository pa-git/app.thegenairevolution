        "In the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) stands out as a powerful technique for enhancing language models with external knowledge. This tutorial will guide you through building a RAG system using LangChain and ChromaDB, enabling you to create applications that are not only intelligent but also contextually aware. By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a solid understanding of integrating language models with vector databases to solve real-world problems like question answering and document summarization.\n",
