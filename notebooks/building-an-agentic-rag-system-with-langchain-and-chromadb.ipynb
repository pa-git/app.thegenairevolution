        "## Introduction to Agentic RAG Systems\n",
        "\n",
        "Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are a cutting-edge approach in AI that enhance the capabilities of language models by intelligently deciding when to retrieve external information or generate responses directly. This dual capability is crucial for applications requiring both extensive knowledge and contextual understanding.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Understanding Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n",
        "\n",
        "Retrieval-Augmented Generation combines the strengths of information retrieval and language generation. By fetching relevant data from external sources, it augments the model's responses, ensuring accuracy and depth. This approach is particularly valuable in scenarios where up-to-date or domain-specific information is crucial.\n",
        "\n",
        "### The Role of Agentic Systems\n",
        "\n",
        "Agentic systems introduce a decision-making layer, determining when to retrieve information and when to rely on the model's internal knowledge. This adaptability is key in creating responsive and efficient AI applications that can handle diverse queries with precision.\n",

        "### Overview of LangChain and ChromaDB\n",
        "\n",
        "LangChain and ChromaDB are pivotal tools in building agentic RAG systems. LangChain facilitates the integration of language models with external data sources, while ChromaDB provides a robust framework for semantic search and data retrieval. Together, they form the backbone of a scalable and efficient RAG system. For a detailed exploration of how these tools can be used in practice, refer to our article on [Building Agentic RAG Systems with LangChain and ChromaDB](/blog/44830763/building-agentic-rag-systems-with-langchain-and-chromadb).\n",

        "### Architecture of a RAG Pipeline\n",
        "\n",
        "A typical RAG pipeline involves several stages: processing user queries, retrieving relevant data, and generating responses. This involves indexing documents for semantic search and creating a retriever tool that efficiently fetches data based on user input.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Document Preprocessing**: Fetch and preprocess documents to ensure they are ready for indexing.\n",
        "2. **Indexing for Semantic Search**: Use ChromaDB to create a semantic index, enabling efficient retrieval.\n",
        "3. **Creating a Retriever Tool**: Develop a tool using LangChain that integrates with the semantic index to fetch relevant data.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Integration with Other Tools\n",
