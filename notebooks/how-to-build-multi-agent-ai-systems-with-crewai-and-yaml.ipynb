        "## Introduction\n\nThis guide walks you through building a multi\\-agent customer feedback analysis system with CrewAI. You will define three specialized agents—one for sentiment evaluation, one for report summarization, and one for visualization—that collaborate in a structured workflow to process raw feedback, generate insights, and produce a final report with charts.\n\nYou will see how to set up agents and tasks in YAML, integrate tools (in this case a CSV\\-file reader) for grounded analysis, validate structured outputs, and produce visualization snippets. All code is ready to run (e.g. in Colab) with minimal setup.\n\nBy the end, you will have a functioning multi\\-agent system that converts raw feedback data into reusable, structured analytical reports.\n\n---\n\n## Building blocks of multi\\-agent systems in CrewAI\n\nWhen you build a multi\\-agent system, think of it like structuring a team. In CrewAI you organize around **Agents**, **Tasks**, **Tools**, **Crews**, and **Training**. These are key to scaling and maintaining the system. CrewAI supports definition of agents and tasks in YAML, separating configuration from code. This makes things easier to manage and adjust over time. ([thegenairevolution.com](https://thegenairevolution.com/building-multi-agent-ai-systems-a-practical-guide-with-crewai/))\n\n### Agents\n\nAgents represent roles, goals, and backstories. You define them in YAML. Each agent is assigned tools (if needed), and memory or code permissions depending on their responsibilities. That keeps responsibilities explicit and helps reduce errors like hallucinations. ([thegenairevolution.com](https://thegenairevolution.com/building-multi-agent-ai-systems-a-practical-guide-with-crewai/))\n\nIf you’re interested in how agent design can be extended to more complex, stateful workflows, our guide on [building a stateful AI agent with LangGraph](https://thegenairevolution.com/blog/44830763/how-to-build-a-stateful-ai-agent-with-langgraph-step-by-step-5) offers a practical, step\\-by\\-step approach.\n\n### Tasks\n\nTasks are what you want agents to do. Each task has:\n\n* A description of what needs to be done\n* An expected output format\n* An agent assignment\n\nYou define tasks separately in YAML. You can have more tasks than agents. One agent may handle multiple tasks. ([thegenairevolution.com](https://thegenairevolution.com/building-multi-agent-ai-systems-a-practical-guide-with-crewai/))\n\nFor a deeper dive into extracting structured information from unstructured data, see our article on [structured data extraction with LLMs](https://thegenairevolution.com/blog/44830763/structured-data-extraction-with-llms-how-to-build-a-pipeline-3), which explores building robust pipelines for production use.\n\n### Tools\n\nTools extend what agents can do. For customer feedback analysis, you will want tools to read CSV files so agents can reference concrete feedback entries. CrewAI has built\\-in tools and you can add custom ones. ([thegenairevolution.com](https://thegenairevolution.com/building-multi-agent-ai-systems-a-practical-guide-with-crewai/))\n\nIf you’re curious about how to optimize tool use and manage data access for agents, the [Model Context Protocol (MCP) guide](https://thegenairevolution.com/blog/44830763/model-context-protocol-mcp-explained-2025-guide-for-builders) explains how to standardize tool and data access for reliable, auditable AI workflows.\n\n### Crews\n\nA Crew ties agents and tasks together into a workflow. You decide how agents collaborate. CrewAI supports several process types including sequential workflows. Sequential means one task follows another. That gives you clarity in dependencies and results. ([thegenairevolution.com](https://thegenairevolution.com/building-multi-agent-ai-systems-a-practical-guide-with-crewai/))\n\n### Training\n\nYou may not get perfect results from the start. CrewAI supports training mode. You can run agents, pause interactions, give feedback, correct mistakes. Agents learn iteratively. This helps adapt the system to your specific data and preferences. ([thegenairevolution.com](https://thegenairevolution.com/building-multi-agent-ai-systems-a-practical-guide-with-crewai/))\n\n---\n\n## Creating a multi\\-agent customer feedback analysis system\n\nLet’s build a system that takes customer feedback data, analyzes sentiment and themes, creates summary tables, makes visualizations, and produces a final Markdown report.\n\n### Installing Requirements"

You integrated a tool to read the CSV feedback data. You set up a workflow that moves from sentiment evaluation to report summarization to visualization and then final report assembly. The arrangement lets each part reference earlier outputs. Configuration lives outside code so you can version control it or adjust it later.\n\nFor those looking to compare this approach with other agent architectures, you might find our tutorial on [building an LLM agent from scratch with GPT\\-4 ReAct](https://thegenairevolution.com/blog/44830763/how-to-build-an-llm-agent-from-scratch-with-gpt-4-react-2) insightful, as it covers tool actions and control loops in detail.\n\nYou may want to extend this by enabling training mode so you can correct agents iteratively. Or try allowing parallel or hybrid process types if some tasks do not depend on earlier ones. If you want to go further, consider exploring structured data extraction pipelines with external tools or compare with ReAct\\-style agents trained from scratch for different trade\\-offs.\n\n---\n\nIf you like, I can also regenerate your version with more examples, visuals, or test data included."
