        "### Step 3: Visualize Metrics with Grafana\n\n1. **Add Prometheus as a Data Source**: In Grafana, navigate to Configuration > Data Sources, and add Prometheus by providing the URL `http://localhost:9090`.\n\n2. **Create a Dashboard**: Use Grafana's dashboard feature to create visualizations of your metrics. For example, you can create a graph to monitor `request_processing_seconds`.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn this tutorial, we've set up a basic monitoring system for a Generative AI application using Prometheus and Grafana. This system allows you to track performance metrics and visualize them in real-time, ensuring your application remains scalable and reliable. As next steps, consider integrating additional metrics or exploring advanced features of Prometheus and Grafana to further enhance your monitoring capabilities. For more information, visit the [Prometheus documentation](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/) and [Grafana documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/).\n\nBy implementing these tools, you'll be well-equipped to maintain and optimize your GenAI systems, ensuring they are production-ready and capable of handling real-world demands."
