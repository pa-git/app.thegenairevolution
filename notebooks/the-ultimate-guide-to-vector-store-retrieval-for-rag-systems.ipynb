        "Retrieval Augmented Generation, RAG, is a powerful design pattern for leveraging large language models. It powers data\\-aware chatbots, customer support assistants, and many other tools. It also solves a key problem. It grounds model responses in real information, which reduces hallucinations.\n\nRAG has two halves. Retrieval and generation. This guide is RAG 101, the retrieval part. You will focus only on how to find the right context for a model. You will create an index, then search it. You will do it first by hand, then with LangChain. You can plug the retrieved results into your LLM later.\n\nThe heart of this tutorial is retrieval. Retrieval is the process of finding and selecting the most relevant documents. Depending on your use case, you can approach retrieval in several ways. Vector store retrieval is the most popular.\n\nIn this walkthrough you will learn the two essential retrieval steps. You will create the index. Then you will search the index. You will see the mechanics clearly. You will also see how LangChain streamlines the same tasks.\n\n### Semantic Similarity Search done manually\n\nSemantic Similarity Search is a widely used retrieval approach. The goal is to identify documents that best match a given input based on meaning. This method works best when you need to match semantic content across text. For example, you may compare a user query to sentences or paragraphs in a document. It is a strong choice when you want to retrieve internal knowledge to enhance customer support. It also helps you add grounded context to LLM responses.\n\nYou will implement Semantic Similarity Search manually using Sentence Transformers for embeddings and ChromaDB as your vector store.\n\n### Setup\n\nBefore you begin, make sure you install the required Python libraries. This example uses:\n\n* chromadb. A fast and efficient vector database.\n* sentence\\-transformers. A library for generating sentence embeddings.\n* PyPDF. A modern library for reading and processing PDF files.\n* langchain. A framework for building LLM\\-powered applications.\n* langchain\\-community. Extensions and integrations for LangChain.\n* langchain\\-huggingface. Tools to use Hugging Face models within LangChain."
