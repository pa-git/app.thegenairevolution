        "# Introduction\n\nIn the rapidly advancing field of artificial intelligence, the integration of diverse data types such as text, images, and audio is becoming increasingly essential. This notebook is designed to guide AI Buildersâ€”software engineers, ML developers, and technical professionalsâ€”through the process of deploying, optimizing, and maintaining Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. By the end of this notebook, you will have a comprehensive understanding of how to implement these systems in a production-ready environment, leveraging frameworks like LangChain and ChromaDB, and employing best practices for scalability and performance.\n\n# Installation\n\nTo get started, we need to install the necessary libraries and frameworks. Run the following command to install the required packages:"
