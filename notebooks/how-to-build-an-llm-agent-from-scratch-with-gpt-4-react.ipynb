        "You probably use agent frameworks like LangChain or BabyAGI without seeing how they work. This tutorial lets you peel back the layers. You will build a ReAct\\-style agent from scratch. This will clarify what AI agents fundamentally are. You will see how they reason, act, and loop with tools‚Äîall without any third\\-party framework. When you understand each part, you also understand what those frameworks are doing for you.\n",
        "\n",
        "The core idea comes from the paper *‚ÄúReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models‚Äù* (arXiv:2210\\.03629\\) by Yao et al. ReAct shows that you improve performance and interpretability when a model both reasons (writes *Thoughts*) and acts (calls tools), interwoven with observations.

        "Building an agent that reasons, calls tools, and iterates without supervision is now straightforward. You control the format. You validate the inputs. You guard against runaway loops. This tutorial shows you how to build a ReAct agent using the OpenAI Python SDK. You will use three simple tools (distance lookup, travel time calculation, sum), a regex\\-based action parser, and a single\\-action\\-per\\-turn control loop with a max\\-turn guard. You will end with a runnable, testable agent. It can answer multi\\-step questions like ‚ÄúHow long to drive from Montreal to Boston at 60 mph?‚Äù\n",
        "\n",
        "**Prerequisites:** Python 3\\.10\\+, an OpenAI API key, and basic familiarity with LLMs. Token usage is minimal. Using `gpt-4o-mini` for tool lookups keeps costs low. This tutorial is Colab\\-ready and starts with a `!pip install` cell.\n",

        "Frameworks add convenience. They also hide behavior. When you build things from scratch, you gain control. You debug faster. You know exactly when and why the model does something.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why use GPT\\-4o and GPT\\-4o\\-mini?**\n",
        "GPT\\-4o gives strong reasoning in the main agent loop. GPT\\-4o\\-mini handles simple tool lookups. It keeps costs and latency balanced without losing reliability.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why ReAct?**\n",
        "The ReAct pattern (Reason \\+ Act) forces the model to articulate its reasoning before taking action. That makes behavior interpretable. A strict format‚ÄîThought ‚Üí Action ‚Üí PAUSE ‚Üí Observation‚Äîlets you parse and validate every step in code.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why regex parsing?**\n",
        "Regex is deterministic. It is fast and transparent. You know exactly what matches and what does not. For production you could swap in JSON\\-based arguments or the OpenAI function\\-call API. Regex is a simple way to start.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## How It Works (High\\-Level Overview)\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Agent receives a question**, then generates a Thought and an Action.\n",
        "Example: `lookup_distance[Montreal, Boston]`.\n",
        "2. **Control loop parses the Action** using regex. It validates it, then calls its Python function.\n",
        "3. **Tool returns a result** (for example, `308 miles`). That becomes the Observation.\n",
        "4. **Agent updates reasoning** using the new info. It either calls another tool or gives a final Answer.\n",
        "5. **Loop stops** once the agent outputs `Answer:` or hits the max turn limit.\n",
