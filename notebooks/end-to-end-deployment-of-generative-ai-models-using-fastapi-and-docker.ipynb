        "In this tutorial, you'll learn how to deploy a Generative AI application using FastAPI and Docker, focusing on best practices for scalability, security, and production-readiness. We'll address common challenges developers face, such as managing dependencies and ensuring efficient deployment. By the end, you'll have a solid understanding of deploying AI models in a production environment and be equipped with actionable insights for optimization and maintenance.\n\n# Introduction\n\nDeploying Generative AI models can be challenging due to the need for managing dependencies, ensuring scalability, and maintaining security. This tutorial will guide you through deploying a FastAPI application with Docker, focusing on best practices for production-readiness. You'll learn how to set up your environment, build a scalable application, and optimize it for performance.\n\n# Setup & Installation\n\nTo get started, you'll need to set up your development environment. We'll use Google Colab for this tutorial, but you can adapt these steps to your local machine if preferred."
