        "In this tutorial, you'll learn how to deploy a Generative AI model using FastAPI and Docker, focusing on creating a scalable and maintainable API service. We'll cover setting up a FastAPI application, containerizing it with Docker, and discuss optimization and maintenance strategies for production-ready deployments. By the end, you'll understand how to integrate these tools into your workflow, enhancing your ability to deploy AI models efficiently.\n\n# Introduction\n\nDeploying Generative AI models can be challenging, especially when aiming for scalability and maintainability. Common issues include managing dependencies, ensuring consistent environments, and optimizing performance. This tutorial will guide you through deploying a simple FastAPI application with Docker, providing insights into containerization and API deployment. You'll also learn about optimization strategies and maintenance practices to ensure your deployment is production-ready.\n\n# Setup & Installation\n\nFirst, ensure you have Docker installed on your machine. If not, you can follow the [Docker installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). You'll also need Python 3.9 or later. For a quick refresher on FastAPI, visit the [FastAPI documentation](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/).\n\n## Installing Required Libraries"
