        "By now, you have probably heard of DeepSeek R1, the open source large language model from Chinese startup DeepSeek. Its release made headlines and even coincided with a selloff in several AI related stocks in U.S. markets. Many reviews have already covered how impressive the model is, so you do not need one more. You will focus on one of the most useful angles instead. You can download the model and run it on your own machine.\n\nWhy would you do that? Maybe you do not want to send data to a third party API. Or you want to control costs. Running locally lets you fine tune the model and customize everything to your stack.\n\nThe good news. Deploying DeepSeek R1 on your own hardware is straightforward. Here is how to do it in 2025\\.\n\n## Get a machine: AWS EC2 instance\n\nFirst, pick a machine to run DeepSeek R1\\. If you are experimenting or building a personal chatbot, your local computer can work. If you are building for production, you might prefer dedicated servers. If you want to get started quickly, a cloud instance is the fastest route.\n\nFor a lightweight start, an AWS EC2 CPU instance is enough for the 1\\.5B parameter variant. In the original example, an m5\\.2xlarge was used. You can still use it. You can also choose a newer generation instance like m7i.2xlarge or m7g.2xlarge to improve price performance.\n\nIf you want faster responses or plan to try larger variants, use a GPU instance. A g6\\.xlarge or g5\\.xlarge is a good baseline. These give you an NVIDIA GPU with enough VRAM for 7B class models at practical quantization levels.\n\nTo launch an EC2 instance, follow the official AWS guide: AWS EC2 Getting Started Guide. <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html>\n\n## Set up your machine\n\nYou will install the essentials needed to run DeepSeek R1\\. Start with a fresh Ubuntu LTS image to keep things clean. Ubuntu 24\\.04 LTS is a solid default in late 2025\\.\n\nConnect to your instance over SSH using AWS’s official steps: Connecting to Your Linux Instance Using SSH. [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/connect\\-linux\\-inst\\-ssh.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/connect-linux-inst-ssh.html)\n\n### Install dependencies"

        "### Download and serve DeepSeek R1 on Ollama\n\nChoose the DeepSeek R1 model variant based on your resources and performance needs. In this walkthrough, you will use DeepSeek R1 1\\.5B, the smallest version available in many community runtimes.\n\nThe 1\\.5B model has 1\\.5 billion parameters. It runs well on consumer hardware or modest cloud instances. It offers lower compute demands and delivers solid results for everyday chat and coding use cases.\n\nAs of late 2025, you can also choose larger variants in Ollama and similar runtimes. For example, several 7B and 8B options are available. Larger models respond more coherently and reason better, but they require more memory. Here is a quick rule of thumb to help you decide:\n\n* CPU only with 16 to 32 GB RAM. Use 1\\.5B or a quantized 7B model.\n* Single mid range GPU with 16 to 24 GB VRAM. Use 7B or 8B quantized models comfortably.\n* High VRAM GPUs. Consider larger models if you need stronger reasoning and can tolerate higher cost."
