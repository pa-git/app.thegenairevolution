        "\n",
        "The Agentic RAG system is composed of several key components: autonomous agents, retrieval tools, and large language models (LLMs). These components work together to retrieve and generate information based on user queries. Autonomous agents act as the decision-makers, retrieval tools extract relevant knowledge from large datasets, and LLMs generate coherent responses. This architecture is designed to handle large-scale data and integrate seamlessly with enterprise systems, addressing common challenges faced by AI Builders.\n",
