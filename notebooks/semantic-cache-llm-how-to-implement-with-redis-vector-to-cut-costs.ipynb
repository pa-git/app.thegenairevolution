        "## Why This Matters\n",
        "\n",
        "Most LLM applications waste money and time answering the same question phrased slightly differently. A semantic cache solves this by recognizing when a new query is semantically similar to a previous one and returning the cached response instantly—no LLM call required.\n",
        "\n",
        "This guide walks you through building a production-grade semantic cache using embeddings and Redis Vector. You'll create a FastAPI microservice with a Redis-backed semantic cache, complete with thresholds, TTLs, and metrics. By the end, you'll have working code, a tunable architecture, and a clear path to immediate latency and cost reductions.\n",
        "\n",
        "**What you'll build:**\n",
        "- A Redis HNSW vector index for semantic similarity search\n",
        "- A cache layer that normalizes queries, generates embeddings, and retrieves cached responses\n",
        "- A FastAPI endpoint to serve cached or fresh LLM answers\n",
        "- A demo script to validate cache hit rates and latency improvements\n",
        "\n",
        "**Prerequisites:**\n",
        "- Python 3.9+\n",
        "- Redis Stack (local via Docker or managed Redis Cloud)\n",
        "- OpenAI API key\n",
        "- Basic familiarity with embeddings and vector search\n",
        "\n",

        "## How It Works (High-Level Overview)\n",
        "\n",
        "**The paraphrase problem:**\n",
        "Users ask the same question in many ways. \"What's your refund policy?\" and \"Can I get my money back?\" are semantically identical, but traditional caching treats them as different keys.\n",
        "\n",
        "**The embedding advantage:**\n",
        "Embeddings map text into a high-dimensional vector space where semantically similar phrases cluster together. By comparing query embeddings using cosine similarity, you can detect paraphrases and return cached responses.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why Redis Vector:**\n",
        "Redis Stack provides HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) indexing for fast approximate nearest neighbor search. It combines low-latency vector search with Redis's native TTL, tagging, and filtering capabilities—ideal for production caching.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Architecture:**\n",
        "1. Normalize the user query (lowercase, strip volatile patterns like timestamps)\n",
        "2. Generate an embedding for the normalized query\n",
        "3. Search the Redis HNSW index for the nearest cached embedding\n",
        "4. If distance < threshold and metadata matches (model, temperature, system prompt hash), return the cached response\n",
        "5. Otherwise, call the LLM, cache the new response with its embedding, and return it\n",
