        "You've built a production-grade semantic cache with Redis Vector. The system normalizes queries, generates embeddings, performs fast vector search, and returns cached responses when similarity is high. This approach cuts latency by 10–20x and reduces LLM costs by 60–80% for repeated queries.\n",
