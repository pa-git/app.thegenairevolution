        "# Building a Memory-Aware Chatbot with Small Language Models\n\n## Introduction\n\nIn the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, Small Language Models (SLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for developers, particularly in resource-constrained environments. These models offer a balance between performance and efficiency, making them ideal for applications where computational resources are limited. In this tutorial, we will guide you through the process of building, deploying, and optimizing a memory-aware chatbot using SLMs. This hands-on guide is designed to help AI Builders integrate SLMs into existing systems and optimize them for production environments, ensuring scalability and security.\n\n## Installation\n\nTo get started, we need to install the necessary libraries. We'll be using the Hugging Face Transformers library, which provides pre-trained models and tokenizers."
